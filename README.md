# cepsearch frontend

## About

Frontend developed to consume the [cepsearch API](https://github.com/WeversonL/cepsearch.git), which I developed to improve my knowledge in Java REST API's. React was used in this frontend, along with other technologies such as Docker, docker-compose and Redis in the backend, so that user requests are answered as quickly as possible.
